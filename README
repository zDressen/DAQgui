Hello! Welcome to the DAQ software.

WARNING: This software is incomplete and currently under development!

TIPS:

In the terminal, the client will output when a request is sent and when it receives a reply.
This can be used as a sanity check to ensure the program is running correctly.

Make sure the box being used supports analog and digital output.

USING PRECODED OUTPUT:
This program supports some precoded wave functionality. To utilize this functionality, enter the
data into the labeled sections in the Analog or Digital channels. Then, begin data acquisition.
When you want the wave to form, press "Generate X Wave" where X is either digital or analog.
Note that only one wave can be output at a time, or the server will crash. If you wish to change
the wave, click "Stop Wave" and then click "Generate X Wave" again.


USING CUSTOM OUTPUT:
This program supports custom analog output. To do so, select "Custom" in the waveform shape dropdown
box. Following selection a new textbox will appear, prompting you to input a file name. This file
MUST be a .xlsx (New Microsoft Excel workbook) file. This file must also be in the same folder as
the server code. I.e. if the server code is found in Downloads/gui/ the workbook must also be in 
Downloads/gui/. Further, set the frequency to AT LEAST half the number of cells in the workbook (NOTE:
the upper limit of this is currently untested).

When using a custom file ensure that all data for Channel 1 is in column A. If using the multi-wave
functionality, please place the custom data for Channel 2 into column B. This is hard-coded into the
server and will not work otherwise.

MULTI-WAVE FUNCTIONALITY:
When using multiple wave functionality you may select "Multiple Waves" at the bottom of either the analog
or digital configuration tab. Then, new boxes should appear under each section to add the data for the
new wave. Adjust this data as before. Then, generate the wave as before.





TO BE DONE:
-Input display vs Output Display?
