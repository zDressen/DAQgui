Hello! Welcome to the DAQ software.

WARNING: This software is incomplete and currently under development!

USING PRECODED OUTPUT:
This program supports some precoded wave functionality. To utilize this functionality, enter the
data into the labeled sections in the Analog or Digital channels. Then, begin data acquisition.
When you want the wave to form, press "Generate X Wave" where X is either digital or analog.
Note that only one wave can be output at a time, or the server will crash. If you wish to change
the wave, click "Stop Wave" and then click "Generate X Wave" again.


USING CUSTOM OUTPUT:
This program supports custom analog output. To do so, select "Custom" in the waveform shape dropdown
box. Following selection a new textbox will appear, prompting you to input a file name. This file
MUST be a .xlsx (New Microsoft Excel workbook) file. This file must also be in the same folder as
the server code. I.e. if the server code is found in Downloads/gui/ the workbook must also be in 
Downloads/gui/. Further, set the frequency to AT LEAST half the number of cells in the workbook (NOTE:
the upper limit of this is currently untested).

When using a custom file ensure that all data for Channel 1 is in column A. If using the multi-wave
functionality, please place the custom data for Channel 2 into column B. This is hard-coded into the
server and will not work otherwise.

MULTI-WAVE FUNCTIONALITY:
When using multiple wave functionality you may select "Multiple Waves" at the bottom of either the analog
or digital configuration tab. Then, new boxes should appear under each section to add the data for the
new wave. Adjust this data as before. Then, generate the wave as before.


RASPI USAGE:
This is a python program system. You must install all of the necessary packages. When installing
the correct packages you may find you need to use a Python Virtual Environment (during development I used
venv). Afterwards, you must run both the server and the GUI at the same time
from two different terminals.

For simplicity, use the following link to github and follow the Linux Installation instructions
for the uldaq library: https://github.com/mccdaq/uldaq

WINDOWS USAGE:
To use this software on a windows device you must use a Linux Virtual Machine.

Using a Linux VM is almost the same as using a RasPi. The only difference is that you may need to
share access to the USB port with the VM first. This can be done from a Windows Powershell Terminal. First,
install the usbipd package. Then run the following commands, replacing #-# with the respective BUSID the 
MCCUSB device is attached to. A list will be given from the first command.
$ usbipd list
$ usbipd bind --busid #-#
$ usbipd attach --wsl --busid #-#
After running these commands, the Linux VM should be able to access the USB Device and function as normal.





TO BE DONE:
-Multiple Input
-Analog Input Config Tab 
  *Split Analog Config into Output and Input
  *Allow selection of visibility and range
-Digital Control Tab
  *Split into a config and control tab
  *Remove Frequency, also instantaneous control
  *Output and Input Channels should ideally be able to freely move between High and Low
  *Review documentation here
-Display Tab
  *This should be renamed Acquisition
  *This should be able to start, stop, etc acquisition
  *Make the plot easier to use and more functional
-Other
  *External Clock Capability
  *Counter Capability
  *Synchronization
  *Multiple Boxes
